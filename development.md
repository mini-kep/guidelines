# Branches

## Branching and PRs

- if there is a ```dev``` branch,  branch from and PR to it 
- in absense of ```dev``` branch from ```master```, and *carefully* PR to it.

Note that ```master``` may be deployed to heroku.

## Branch naming

1. Use prefix:
   - `dev` (feature, enhancement), use this when in doubt
   - `fix` (bugs, bad behavior)
   - `test` (working on tests exclusively)   
2. Put a few words inside 
3. Postfix with issue number 
4. Use `-` to separate 

Pattern: ```dev-something-somehting-123```

Examples:

- ```dev-compress-dataset-71```
- ```fix-large-dataset-fault-10```
- ```test-csv-serialialiser-2```

# Github

Github avatar and username are very personal things, this part of guidelines 
not mandatory, but it makes life easier, if:

- avatar is distiguishable from others:
  - not a standard avtar, like all others
  - not a greyish/brownish picture, like all others
  
- username has some association to who you are, unless disambiguation is intentional

- a memorable, short and easy to type username is better
